				<p><h2>Method of Locii (Durational)</h2></p>
<p class="title">Studio Practice</p>


<p><img src="/images/memorypalace.jpg" class="circle"></p>
<p>The Memory Palace is a virtual reality environment, initially developed by myself and Ben Vickers, as an alternative system that seeks to merge online virtual reality platforms with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci">method of loci</a>, for the expressed purpose of enhancing, ensuring ownership and terraforming the scope of distributed collective memory.</p>
<p>In July 2015, a guided walkthrough of the Memory Palace was presented at Space Caviar&#39;s <a href="http://www.spacecaviar.net/projects/ram-house/">RAM House</a>, installed at Museo the d&#39;Arte Contemporanea di Villa Croce in Genova, Italy. This prototype is accessible online through <a href="http://www.janusvr.com/">Janus VR</a>: on the top floor, west side of the Bit Tower hotel.</p>
<p>The Method of Locii is an ongoing durational project in development for collective experimentation with virtual reality. The virtual environment can be used as daily practice and ritual which accumulates objects-of-memory, as well as in workshops, LARPs and online communities.</p>
<p>The original text accompanying the walkthrough is below.</p>
<p><p class="details">
<em>We live in an age in which we outsource our memories to vast warehouse complexes in the desert, archiving our past on platters of aluminium or glass and ceramic substrate.</em>
</p></p>
<p><p class="details">
<em>Imagine a temple that you know well or are intimately involved with: perhaps this is Jetavanaramaya, Cambodia’s Angkor Wat, the Ise Jingu shrine, or Gobekli Tepe.</em>
</p></p>
<p><p class="details">
<em>Within Gobekli Tepe’s circling halls there are a number of enclaves, inside of which are features and objects in known positions, some of these objects are likely to have been used in rituals that have been forgotten for millennia. Within these spaces, you can learn a new technique.</em>
</p></p>
<p><p class="details">
<em>The basis for the Method of Loci is that by committing the layout of a building to memory, narratives and facts can be associated, and stored, within its objects and enclaves. By traversing the spaces of this building and recalling objects within the room, the associated knowledge can also be retrieved. This is otherwise known as the Memory Palace, a mnemonic device adopted in ancient Roman and Greek rhetorical treatises. In basic terms, it is a method of memory enhancement which uses visualization to organize and recall information.</em>
