unMonastery is a way to radically re-vision distributed communities during a time of environmental, infrastructural, and economic volatility.

Interweaving the history of monasticism and hackerspace design patterns, the social innovation project is in the process of building a network of long-term and outward-facing cooperative living spaces to cultivate service-oriented, meaningful work as a means of both personal and collective resilience.

From two yearsâ€™ experience in setting up Test Lab co-living sites in [Matera, Italy](http://matera.unmonastery.org) and [Athens, Greece](http://athens.unmonastery.org) to support and work with the surrounding community, unMonastery has amassed a library of documentation, tools, templates and reflection on the present and possible futures of living together, known as the [unMonastery BIOS](unmonastery.org/bios).

unMonastery Test Labs combine an experimental place for studying new ways of living together and new ways of balancing meaningful work with working for a living, offering home to distributed research and development of reality-shattering projects that address deep future needs. Based on the unMonastery library and design patterns, the intentions and goals of a Test Lab are focused on concrete research proposals. These can be a desire to build something with the surrounding community or with an aim to improve and adapt existing collective living spaces. The project welcomes [participation](http://unmonastery.org/participate).

Working toward establishing a long-term, larger scale residence in 2017, the unMonastery frames the possibility of an open source monastic order as a foundation for solidarity through adaptive, chimeric networks and sustainable mutual aid.
