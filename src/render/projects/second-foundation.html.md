Myself and Claire Tolan initiated Second Foundation while in-residence at the White Building Centre for Art and Technology in 2015.

Inspired by Roy Ascott's [Groundcourse](https://frieze.com/article/degree-zero), we hosted events at the White Building and the <a href="http://www.spacestudios.org.uk/art-technology/second-foundation-at-the-goethe-institute/" target="_blank">Goethe Institute London</a> playing with protocols for participatory group interaction.

While currently in stealth mode, the project will continue its chance explorations through happenings in Berlin this coming winter. The original text accompanying the events is below.

<p class="details">A person pushed on a trolley down the hallway, allowed ten-minute
speaking intervals; tennis balls thrown against an unstable surface, the
sound of collision recorded and played on loop. In the corridors of
Ealing School of Art, this was Groundcourse, a pedagogy inspired by
cybernetics and developed by Roy Ascott to integrate art, science, and
behavioural studies. Given personality constructs to enact and develop,
students functioned in groups of six as entangled systems, each aware of
the other's assigned limitations. Intrinsic to the Groundcourse pedagogy
were the interplay of spontaneity and deliberate chance operations. The
behaviours developed through collective improvisation within a set of
constraints led to new imaginations of social relations and an explosion
of the ethos of individualism.</p>
