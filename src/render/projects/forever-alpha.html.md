<h2>Forever Alpha</h2>
<p class="title">Initiator, Event Platform and Public Hackspace</p>

<img class="circle" src="/images/foreveralpha.png">

Forever Alpha is an Experiential Platform for [biohacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do-it-yourself_biology) and P2P learning. Over the course of 2016, [Schillerpalais project space](http://www.top-ev.de/schillerpalais/) hosted a series of Forever Alpha events focused on DIY biology.

These events have contributed toward opening the project space as a public, cooperatively-run biohacklab in early 2017.

I initiated the Forever Alpha concept, and I coordinate events and co-manage the project space.
