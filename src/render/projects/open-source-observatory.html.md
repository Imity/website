Open Source Observatory is a distributed network of sites and gatherings for the observation of satellites, spacecraft and space junk.

Founded in late 2015 and drawing inspiration from the Association of Autonomous Astronauts, OSO looks toward building a satellite skywatch and a way to come together: bringing out infrastructure for observation to distant fields and connecting unlikely locations. The initiative includes:

*  Gatherings for satellite watching, trading info, infrastructure and sometimes snacks.
*  The opening of two permanent observatory sites in late 2016.
*  The support and development of open source hardware and software for space observation.
*  The design of a modular observatory that can be built easily with affordable or found materials and protect equipment in different climates.
*  An online forum and dead drop boxes for discussions on artificial satellitesâ€”from their history and hardware to their singular aesthetic.
*  Reading groups for speculation and creation of commons-oriented space initiatives.

Gatherings wll be ongoing from the spring at Schillerpalais, and two permanent OSO sites will launch in late 2016 in Berlin, DE and Athens, GR, through a community with the [Libre Space Foundation](https://librespacefoundation.org/).
