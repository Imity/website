Open Space Observatory is a distributed network of sites and gatherings for the observation of satellites, spacecraft and space junk.

The initiative includes the opening of three permanent satellite observatory sites in 2017, the support and development of open source hardware and software working in collaboration with the [Libre Space Foundation](https://librespacefoundation.org/), and the design of a modular observatory that can be built easily with affordable or found materials and protect equipment in different climates.

Additionally, the OSO researches the deep history of astronomical architectures, speculative trajectories of their future use and the potential for collective narratives of satellite constellations.

We are currently working with two major UK institutions to install permanent observatories and host participatory workshops on cultural and technical narratives of satellites in 2017-18.

Drawing from research for my [PROX.IMITY](/projects/proximity) project, I initiated the OSO concept, and I coordinate the initiative's design, development and related workshops. Collaborators include [studiofolder.it](http://www.studiofolder.it/), [Fabi Borges](https://catahistorias.wordpress.com/) and the [Global Ports Authority](http://gpaworldports.org) project.
