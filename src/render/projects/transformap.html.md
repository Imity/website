Today there is no single resource to easily identify and directly benefit from social innovations, either in your neighborhood or globally. While an economy based on horizontal collaboration for the common good is becoming more visible with initiatives around repairing, bartering, co-producing, co-using, commoning, and Transition initiatives, it is extremely hard to get an overview of this global transformation.

TransforMap is a collaborative project that aims to answer this challenge and its complexities. It seeks to co-develop with users - common citizens as well as representatives of the different movements - the necessary tools and standards for free and open crowd mapping, common taxonomies, and aggregating initiatives in one mapping tool that can be navigated by neophytes. TransforMap is being developed by, and offers the opportunity to display, all initiatives that belong to communities of practice around solidarity economies&#8212;hoping to combat duplication of efforts and facilitate cross-collaboration.
