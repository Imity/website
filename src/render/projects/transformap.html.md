<h2>TransforMap</h2>
<p class="title">Web Developer</p>

TransforMap is a collaborative project that aims to create an overview of commons-based initiatives and "map the mappings." It seeks to co-develop with users the necessary tools and standards for free and open crowd mapping, common taxonomies, and aggregating initiatives in one mapping tool that can be navigated by neophytes. TransforMap is being developed by, and offers the opportunity to display, all initiatives that belong to communities of practice around solidarity economies&#8212;hoping to combat duplication of efforts and facilitate cross-collaboration.

I designed and developed the TransforMap website and implemented BackboneJS and LeafletJS frameworks for open source, community-created maps.
